# Price Tracking Application: Track Price Changes of Amazon.com Products

## Overview

Create a price tracking system for products on Amazon. There are discounts offerred on products throughout the year
on Amazon, and if you want to buy a product at a set target price, running a single script manually everyday is cumbersome.
You want to be notified about it with a system running 24/7 in the background. This is my attempt at creating a serverless application
to keep track of product prices against a target price.
